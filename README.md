# NYT Top Stories Reader

This Ruby CLI program allows users to interact with the current day's New York Times (NYT) headlines, through requests to the NYT API.

The user can:
    --Retrieve the headlines from any NYT section
    --View a brief summary of and details the corresponding article
    --Open articles in a browser

## Installation

1) Clone the nyt_topstories repository onto your computer. The project folder is named nyt_topstories
2) CD into the project folder and execute:

`ruby bin/run`

Troubleshooting:
1) If gems do not load automatically, run "bundle install" in the project folder to install all programs listed in Gemfile

Will be registered as a gem at a later time; currently functioning as a local application.
